# 1.3 AI Project Setup

## 1. Understand Workflow

Let's walk through the steps required to create an Azure AI Agent Services solution. In this section, we'll complete the first three steps of the workflow **to setup our AI Project**

1. [ ] Create an [Azure AI Hub](hhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/create-azure-ai-resource?tabs=portal) resource to manage AI resources and environment.
1. [ ] Create an [Azure AI Project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/create-projects?tabs=ai-studio) resource to deploy an endpoint for your app.
1. [ ] Attach a relevant [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/overview?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-studio%2Fcontext%2Fcontext) or [Azure AI Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/what-are-ai-services?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-studio%2Fcontext%2Fcontext) resource.
1. [ ] Choose [Basic or Standard Agent Setup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart?pivots=programming-language-python-azure#choose-basic-or-standard-agent-setup) based on targered scenario
1. [ ] Customize [Model Selection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart?pivots=programming-language-python-azure#optional-model-selection-in-autodeploy-template) in autodeploy template (optional)
1. [ ] Customize [AI Resources Used](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart?pivots=programming-language-python-azure#optional-use-your-own-resources-during-agent-setup) in autodeploy template (optional)
1. [ ] Configure [and run the first agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart?pivots=programming-language-python-azure#configure-and-run-an-agent)

## 2. Understand Azure AI Foundry

Before we jump into the details of project setup, it helps to get a sense of the Azure AI Foundry architecture, and how it relates to our current quickstart workflow. **The figure provides the big picture - click on tabs below to get brief explainers on the core components shown**.

![Azure AI Foundry Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/media/concepts/ai-studio-architecture.png)

=== "Azure AI Foundry"

    [Azure AI Foundry](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/architecture) in an enterprise-grade unified platform for building generative AI applications end-to-end on Azure. It provides access to the following resources:

    - **Azure OpenAI** - discover, deploy, and use, the latest Open AI models.
    - **Management Center** - streamline _governance_ of your Azure AI resources.
    - **AI Foundry Hub** - top-level resource based on Azure ML service, for admin.
    - **AI Foundry Project** - child-resource for hub, with developer tools & apps.
    - **Connections** - connect Azure AI hubs/projects to other resources (e.g., data).
    

=== "Azure AI Hub"

    [Azure AI Hubs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/create-azure-ai-resource?tabs=portal) provide the **environment for a team** to collaborate and organize work, and help you (as a team lead or IT admin) centrally set up security settings and govern usage and spend. Once a hub is created, developers can create projects from it, and access shared company resources without needing repeated help from IT admins.

=== "Azure AI Project"

    [Azure AI Projects](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/create-projects?tabs=ai-studio) are hosted by an Azure AI Foundry hub and used to **organize your work and save state** while building customized AI apps. You can create a project from an existing hub, or create it solo and have a  new hub resource automatically created for you. Projects provide a comprehensive set of tools for building, testing, tracing, and deploying, your GenAI applications with enterprise-grade security and access management support.

=== "Azure AI Services"

    [Azure AI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/what-are-ai-services) help developers and organizations rapidly create intelligent, cutting-edge, market-ready, and responsible applications with out-of-the-box and prebuilt and customizable APIs and models. Most services are available via [REST APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/reference/rest-api-resources) and [client SDKs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/reference/sdk-package-resources?pivots=programming-language-csharp). Example AI services include: _Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, Content Safety, Ciustom Vision, Document Intelligence, Speech, Vision, and more_. **See: [Azure AI Services Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/) for options**.

=== "Azure Open AI Service"

    [Azure Open AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/) provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful language models including o1, o1-mini, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, GPT-4 Turbo with Vision, GPT-4, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and Embeddings model series. Users can access the service through its REST APIs, Python SDK, or via the Azure AI Foundry portal.

=== "Connections"

    [Connections](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/connections) in Azure AI Foundry portal are **a way to authenticate and consume both Microsoft and non-Microsoft resources** within your AI Foundry projects. A connection can be created exclusively per-project, or be defined at hub-level and shared across all its attached projects.
    
    - An _API key connection_ is the most common **non-Microsoft** connection type, and handles authentication to a target on an individual basis. 
    - A _custom connection_ requires you to **manage the authentication yourself**, but provides. a way to securely store and access relevant credentials. 
    - A _data connection_ helps access remote datastores without copying data over to your project. This also enables a **commmon API across diverse data store types**.

    Azure connections **serve as key vault proxies**, and interactions with connections are direct interactions with an Azure key vault - allowing you to store credentials, authenticate access, and consume data and information in a secure manner.

=== "Management Center"

    [Management Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/management-center) is the component of Azure AI Foundry portal that **streamlines governance and management activities**. Use it as a central location to manage all your hubs, projects, resources, and settings. For instance, you can view and manage quotas, review usage metrics, assign roles, manage users, and see connected resources.
