Now that you understand the building blocks for an Azure AI Architecture, let's walk through the steps required to create an Azure AI Agent Services solution.

## 1 Understand Workflow

To get started with the Azure AI Agent Services, we use this workflow. In this section, we'll complete the first three steps.

1. [ ] Create an [Azure AI Hub](hhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/create-azure-ai-resource?tabs=portal) resource to manage AI resources and environment.
1. [ ] Create an [Azure AI Project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/create-projects?tabs=ai-studio) resource to deploy an endpoint for your app.
1. [ ] Attach a relevant [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/overview?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-studio%2Fcontext%2Fcontext) or [Azure AI Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/what-are-ai-services?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-studio%2Fcontext%2Fcontext) resource.
1. [ ] Choose [Basic or Standard Agent Setup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart?pivots=programming-language-python-azure#choose-basic-or-standard-agent-setup) based on targered scenario
1. [ ] Customize [Model Selection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart?pivots=programming-language-python-azure#optional-model-selection-in-autodeploy-template) in autodeploy template (optional)
1. [ ] Customize [AI Resources Used](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart?pivots=programming-language-python-azure#optional-use-your-own-resources-during-agent-setup) in autodeploy template (optional)
1. [ ] Configure [and run the first agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart?pivots=programming-language-python-azure#configure-and-run-an-agent)

**In this section we'll complete steps 1-3** and simplify this workflow where possible.
