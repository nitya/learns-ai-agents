# About Me

Welcome to my world! **My name is Nitya Narasimhan and I am a PhD, a Polyglot, and a Parent.** I've worked in tech for nearly three decades in roles spanning research, engineering, and advocacy. I've also been a community leader in the Greater New York region for over a decade, organizing meetups and conferences that have skilled thousands of developers. Most importantly, as a parent and educator, I am increasingly invested in **helping people learn AI** in a way that makes these complex topics feel more relatable with ready-to-use resources that help translate awareness into action.

My day job as an AI advocate at Microsoft is focused on the Azure AI platform. But my personal interests span a variety of topics from open-source tooling to visual storytelling and creative content projects that put the _fun_ in fundamentals. I wanted to do something that helped me bridge these personas. Say hello to **Nitya Learns AI** - an extension of my [#30DaysOf](https://github.com/30DaysOf) learning mentality applied to the fast-moving world of AI. Keep an eye out for:

 - My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nityan) newsletter with this name (coming in 2025)
 - The [nitya-learns-ai](https://github.com/topics/nitya-learns-ai) topic on GitHub, tagging relevant projects
 - A #NityaLearnsAI series of videos and illustrated guides - site TBA.
 
**Learn with me and commit to adding one AI-related skill to your toolkit in 2025**
