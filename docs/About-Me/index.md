# About Me

Welcome to my world! **My name is Nitya Narasimhan and I am a PhD, a Polyglot, and a Parent.** I've worked in tech for nearly three decades in roles spanning research, engineering, and advocacy. I've also been a community leader in the Greater New York region for over a decade, organizing meetups and conferences that have skilled thousands of developers. 

As a parent and educator, I'm becoming increasingly invested in **helping people learn AI** in a way that makes complex topics feel more relatable to their lives, and in providing them with hands-on learning resources that help translate awareness into action.

My day job as an AI advocate at Microsoft is focused on the Azure AI platform. But my personal interests span a variety of topics from open-source tooling to visual storytelling and creative content projects that put the _fun_ in fundamentals. 

**Nitya Learns AI** is my 2025 initiative to help me bridge those personas. It builds on my learnings from my [#30DaysOf](https://github.com/30DaysOf) initiative, but with a focus on personal growth and experimentation. How can you track my progress? Look for these resources in 2025:

 - My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nityan) newsletter with this name (coming in 2025)
 - The [nitya-learns-ai](https://github.com/topics/nitya-learns-ai) topic on GitHub, tagging relevant projects
 - The #NityaLearnsAI tag on videos and illustrated guides - website TBA
 
**Learn with me - make a resolution to add AI to your engineering toolkit in 2025!**
