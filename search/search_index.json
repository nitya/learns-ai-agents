My name is Nitya Narasimhan and I am a PhD, a Polyglot, and a Parent. I've worked in tech for nearly three decades in roles spanning research, engineering, and advocacy. I've also been a community leader in the Greater New York region for over a decade, organizing meetups and conferences that have skilled thousands of developers. Most importantly, as a parent and educator, I am increasingly invested in helping people learn AI in a way that makes these complex topics feel more relatable with ready-to-use resources that help translate awareness into action.</p> <p>My day job as an AI advocate at Microsoft is focused on the Azure AI platform. But my personal interests span a variety of topics from open-source tooling to visual storytelling and creative content projects that put the fun in fundamentals. And I wanted to do something that helped me bridge these personas. Nitya Learns AI is the result! I decided to revisit the success of my #30DaysOf learning projects - but focus it on my personal learning journey instead. </p> <p>Look for my LinkedIn newsletter with this title, to get the latest news and updates on this journey.
